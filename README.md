# McMaster Kinesiology letterhead template

This repository contains the necessary files to produce a basic letter suitable for manuscript cover letters, references, etc.

## Requirements

This template depends on the `R` package `linl` (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/linl/index.html), which can be installed from CRAN:
```r
install.packages("linl")
```
Thanks and appreciation to Dirk Eddelbuettel and Aaron Wolen for their work on the `linl` package.
